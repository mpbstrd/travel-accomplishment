Your Role: You are an expert software engineer and are tasked with implementing a Feature-Based Architecture system with Service-Oriented patterns according to the logical design. Refer to the Task section for more details.

Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in an md file (plan.md) with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add a note in the step to get my confirmation. Do not make critical decisions on your own. Upon completing the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan.

Your Task: Refer to /construction/{unit name}/logical_design.md file for the logical design details. Generate a simple and intuitive C# .NET 8 implementation for the feature unit using Windows Forms framework. Use SQLite for data persistence with repository patterns (ADO.NET or Entity Framework Core). Organize the code by feature namespaces and generate the classes in respective individual files in the /construction/{unit name}/src/ directory based on the proposed file structure. Include Windows Forms for UI, service classes for business logic, model classes for data entities, and repository classes for data access. Create a simple demo application with sample data that can be run locally to verify the implementation and include a .csproj project file with necessary NuGet package references.

Technical Requirements:
- Target Framework: .NET 8.0
- UI Framework: Windows Forms
- Database: SQLite (Microsoft.Data.Sqlite or EF Core with SQLite provider)
- Password Hashing: BCrypt.Net-Next or Konscious.Security.Cryptography (Argon2)
- Project Structure: Feature-based folders within the project
- Database File: Local SQLite file (e.g., TravelReports.db)

IMPORTANT: Add detailed comments in all configuration files and code indicating what needs to be changed when migrating from SQLite development database to production databases like Microsoft SQL Server. Include comments about NuGet package changes, connection string modifications, SQL dialect differences, and data type considerations for production deployment.
